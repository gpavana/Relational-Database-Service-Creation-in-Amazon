# RELATIONAL DATABASE SERVICE CREATION IN AMAZON
 
## AIM
To create and configure a Relational Database Service (RDS) instance in Amazon Web Services (AWS).
       
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The experiment aims to demonstrate the creation of an Amazon RDS instance for hosting a relational database in the cloud. This includes configuring database settings, connecting to the instance, and testing database functionality using SQL commands.

## ALGORITHM

 ### Steps 1:
 Log in to the AWS Management Console and Search for RDS in the search bar and click on the Relational Database Service option..
 
 ### Steps 2:
 Click on Create database, select a database engine (e.g., MySQL), and choose a deployment model (e.g., Standard Create).
 
 ### Steps 3:
 Specify database instance settings, including the instance size, storage type, username, and password.
 
 ### Steps 4:
 Configure network settings, including VPC, Subnet Group, and Security Group to allow access to the database.
 
 ### Steps 5:
 Launch the RDS instance, connect to it using a database client (e.g., MySQL Workbench or CLI), and test its functionality by creating and querying a sample table.

 
## COMMANDS
### Connect the database
```sql
mysql -h <endpoint> -u <username> -p
```

## OUTPUT
### REG NUMBER: 212222230105
### NAME: PAVANA G
